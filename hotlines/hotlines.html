            <strong> To Do In An Emergency Or Crisis</strong>
            <br> No one wants to experience a crisis, but they do happen. Fortunately, there are people and organizations willing
            and able to help. Use these resources if you or someone you know is experiencing a crisis. It’s important to
            identify the correct options and seek help quickly in a crisis situation.
            <br>
            <strong>In An Emergency</strong>
            <br> If you or a loved one is in immediate danger calling 911 and talking with police may be necessary. It is important
            to notify the operator that it is a psychiatric emergency and ask for an officer trained in crisis intervention
            or trained to assist people experiencing a psychiatric emergency.

            Preparing For A Possible Crisis Taking steps to prepare for the possibility of a crisis can help you act quickly, ease your
            mind and lessen the impact if a crisis situation does occur. Understanding the differences between mental health
            crisis services and how to access them are a vital step towards being prepared. Your local NAMI can help you
            locate these services in your community. A crisis plan is a document that contains important information and
            outlines how to respond to a crisis situation. Many healthcare providers require patients to create a crisis
            plan that include: phone numbers of mental health professions, family members and friends a list of current prescription
            medications, doses and diagnosis any history of suicide attempts, psychosis or drug use history triggers and
            coping mechanism that have helped in the past About The NAMI HelpLine The NAMI HelpLine is a free service that
            provides information, referrals and support to people living with a mental health condition, family members and
            caregivers, mental health providers and the public. A well-trained and knowledgeable team of volunteers, interns
            and HelpLine staff will respond to your call or message. Many staff members and volunteers live with a mental
            health condition or provide care and support to a family member or friend. The HelpLine also has volunteer attorneys
            and legal interns who provide legal expertise or a referral to an attorney in your community.</p>
